### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Java Software Engineer at [Scout24](https://www.scout24.com/) in Berlin. In my spare time I'm blogging about the [Spring Framework](https://rieckpil.de/category/spring-framework/), [Jakarta EE](https://rieckpil.de/category/jakarta-ee/) and [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://rieckpil.de/category/microprofile/) at [https://rieckpil.de](https://rieckpil.de).
