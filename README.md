### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an independent IT-Consultant (all things #Java #Kotlin #AWS #SpringBoot) located Berlin. With my [blogging](https://rieckpil.de) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/rieckpil) efforts I try to **make testing Java applications more joyful** (or at least less painful) by providing recipes for unit/integration/end-to-end testing real-world applications.

Here's an excerpt of my current projects:

- [Testing Spring Boot Applications Masterclass](https://rieckpil.de/testing-spring-boot-applications-masterclass/)
- [Stratospheric - From Zero To Production With Spring Boot And AWS](https://stratospheric.dev)
- [14 Days Free Email Course To Accelerate Your Testing Success](https://rieckpil.de/getting-started-with-testing-java-applications-email-course/)

Upcoming projects:

- [Hands-On Mocking With Mockito (Online Course)](https://rieckpil.de/hands-on-mocking-with-mockito-online-course/)
- [30 Testing Tools & Libraries Every Java Developer Must Know (eBook)](https://rieckpil.de/testing-tools-and-libraries-every-java-developer-must-know/)
